Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project is intended to create a basic app for teaching high school students about fiscal responsibility. The application is designed so that it will show interest and how that interest will grow over time. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well with producing effective functionality. I would rather have a basic app that functions, than a pretty app that breaks, so I focused more on the structure and whether or not it was working.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think I could use more practice with objects and classes, as I think that they could help me make my code much more efficient and secure with the use of private/public classes. I did not find them overly easy to comprehend, but I think more practice will make them more understandable

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found it most difficult to sort the header and main files, as I was trying to add too much or too little at first. I took more time to re-check my learning materials for examples to reference, so that I could code appropriately and efficiently.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I feel that C++ by itself will be a transferable skill for other project, as it is very helpful to know more than one programming language. I've learned a little Java, but I don't really prefer Java, so having C++ and Python is nice.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made a header file with the functions I wanted to include, including the public and private classes I wanted to set. Then in the main function, I made sure to call the header file, and set my output and input functions for the display and user data. I worked to keep the coding as simple as possible to prevent code errors, and left plenty of areas for input user data to get the appropriate user data.
